					<p>PH got me through a really tough time as well as the 2020 lockdown, and that’s to your beautiful webtoon I got to meet some phenomenal people that I’m honoured to call my friends. Soph and Eph you guys are amazing and deserve the world, and thank you for building a world for us to be so invested in!!! (Thanks not so much for wrecking my sleeping pattern, webtoons update at 2am for me ehe)</p>

					<p>One of the things I have been so fortunate to experience was Purple Hyacinth. It isn't just a comic, it has been an experience - the incredible music, the compelling plot, the stunning art and the amazing community. PH was an absolute joy to read and I couldn't be more grateful that I found it one fateful Monday afternoon during class. Ever since, I have been looking forward to Tuesdays so I could read the next chapter; after each one I would be left eager for the next but stunned with the gorgeous art, story and characters. None of this would have been possible without Soph and Eph, and for that I just wanted to say thank you! Your work has done more than just entertain and you cannot imagine how addicted I have been to PH since I found it. Your hardwork and commitment has clearly paid off because you have produced such a fascinating story and cultivated a welcoming community. Thank you Eph and Soph, this experience was truly remarkable.

					<p>I want to thankyou for creating this webtoon , I'm not exaggerating when I say I LOVE IT. ❤ I have make so many great friends in this fandom. I've loved these last fue years despite the dark times we've all face but they were a bit less dark when I read this , I've loved reading this story and watching the characters and their relationship grow , I can't wait to see where you take this story next. I know there's gonna be alot more tears to come but I still got a life time supply of 🧻 from covid so I'm set up 😄👍. All that aside I just want to thank you, again, I always use to think it was sad when people said books and comics were one of the most important things in their life but I get it now! I LOVE these characters I don't care if there fictional because their real to me + thanks the writing and fanfics somehow made English my favorite lesson (so my grades say thx)

					<p>Thank you all sincerely for all the time and effort you put into this webtoon to make it how it is today. I have been reading Purple Hyacinth ever since it came out on Canvas and it was amazing to see how much the fandom has grown. Purple Hyacinth was one of the first webtoons I’ve ever read and it’s by far the greatest webtoon I’ve read ever since it came out on Canvas. From the plot, music, and art, I truly appreciate all the work you guys put into the webtoon. I’ve have gotten amazing friends from reading Purple Hyacinth and I really wish you guys the best for your future endeavors. Also it was a lot fun helping to make this website and its card generator so I hope you enjoy this website for the anniversary! 🥳</p>

						Thank you so much for, well, you. Without your art, your story, your perseverance, I never would have met some of my best friends. These past two years wouldn’t have been as beautiful and joyous as they have been without you guys. So sincerely, from the bottom of my heart, thank you.</p>

					<p>Thank you both for putting so much work and heart into Purple hyacinth. I am an aspiring webtoon artist and your work has inspired me greatly to keep writing and drawing. The writing for each character is beautiful and unique. While the art is amazing at capturing your characters expressions and the environments they're put into. I am beyond thankful for both of your hard work and dedication. Purple hyacinth (and Kym, mostly Kym) will always hold a special place in my heart. Thank you for everything</p>

					<p>Thank you, Eph and Soph, for the heartwarming, tear-jerking, emotional rollercoaster of a story. I absolutely love it. The Purple Hyacinth is such an amazing series (especially when you start reading it on a school night from 11 pm to 2 am). I truly love your series. It's an amazing inspiration for both my art itself and the comics that I'm currently building and making. Also for the characters, I'm making. </p>

					<p>Hi Eph and Soph! I first starting reading PH a few months ago and I absolutely love it! The series is so addicting and well-written. I adore the character designs as well, Kym is so lovable and the life of the party but most of the time is a facade, Will is the responsible type who feels like he has to shoulder everything after Rafael left but, in truth, he can't. Lauren is depriving herself of sleep all because of her trauma of losing her childhood best friend, Dylan and would sacrifice anything to stop the PS once and for all. But in acting as Lune with Kieran, she both saved Ardhalis from catastrophe for another day and traumatized her family and loved ones. We saw in recent episodes how Kym and Will felt, believing, thinking they lost their best friend. Will bottles it up but losing yet another best friend to a fire and/or explosion must have been a horrible experience. We also have yet to see Kieran's full backstory. I'd like to keep this short, so you two have made an amazing story and I can't wait to see more!</p>

					<p>Eph, Soph, thank you so much for your hard work. PH has been a safe harbor even amidst the stormy periods in life. The art, the story, the music, the cast, and the sass... I'm always looking forward to everything. I have loved Purple Hyacinth since the moment I first read it on Canvas, and I'll love it even after it becomes a daily pass post completion. Thank you once again for such a wonderful creation.</p>

					<p>Thank you guys so much for the work you put into PH. It's one of the few webtoons I can confidently shamelessly advertise to my friends (this probably doesn't make sense but its the most refreshing thing I swear). I wish you the best of luck moving forward! </p>

					<p>happy third anniversary! 🥳
						even though i'm a fairly recent fan of PH, i'd like to say thank you for creating such a beautiful story. every single episode has had so much thought and care put into it from the art, to the music and most importantly, the characters themselves. 
						
						also, i've enjoyed talking to other people in the community about PH-sometimes conspiring, discussing the latest chapters and the characters. 
						
						purple hyancith has made my tuesdays a little brighter and given me (and all the other readers of PH) another story to look forward to. :)

					<p>It was my sister's friend who introduced me to purple hyacinth a year ago and at first i was quite hesitant to read it because of the gore and stuff. But now i am so glad that i finally decided to give it a try. It truly is such an amazing and wonderful webtoon that quickly became one of my favourites. Thank you for all your hardwork that you have put in making this masterpiece. Don't ever stop what you are doing!!

					<p>Soph and eph-
						I have only been reading Purple Hyacinth for a little under a year and I have already falling in love with this webtoon series. The way you guys spin a tale of murder with just a hint of comedy is nothing short of spectacular. Thank you for this amazing gift.

					<p>Truthfully, Purple Hyacinth has inspired me so. damn. much. Whenever I read this story I am always in awe. The way I could feel/empathize with the characters. Every time my heart beats faster when I listen to the thrilling music and every time my nerves would calm down when I listen to the relaxing/somber music (I love the songs so much) The plot never ceases to surprise me (neyra, tell us who died) This comic means a lot to me and I thank you super skilled creators for sharing this to the world. ilysfm

					<p>I really want to thank you for all the effort you put into working on this wonderful story. We've all witnessed the progress of the art and the plot throughout the first, second, and now third season, and I'm sure we can all agree that the quality of this story is always growing and improving nonstop. Purple Hyacinth was not the first webtoon I read but it was (and still is) the best one so far. I love the complexity of the characters, the setting of the events, how interwoven everything is, the incredible music that flows with the episodes (it was the first time I read a chapter with a specific song meant for it and I'm blown away every single time) and all the special effects and "touches" that make this reading an unique experience. I have learnt how to appreciate every detail and I'm always amazed by it, because this is a true masterpiece. Thank you for trusting and showing us this story (I've recommended PH to literally everyone who's ever met me lol) and for keep working hard all these years on it, despite the doubts and all the difficulties that we are not aware of. I wish you all the strength for now and for the future! We will be here until the end.
