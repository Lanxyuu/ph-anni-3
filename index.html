					<p>One of the things I have been so fortunate to experience was Purple Hyacinth. It isn't just a
						comic, it has been an experience - the incredible music, the compelling plot, the stunning art
						and the amazing community. PH was an absolute joy to read and I couldn't be more grateful that I
						found it one fateful Monday afternoon during class. Ever since, I have been looking forward to
						Tuesdays so I could read the next chapter; after each one I would be left eager for the next but
						stunned with the gorgeous art, story and characters. None of this would have been possible
						without Soph and Eph, and for that I just wanted to say thank you! Your work has done more than
						just entertain and you cannot imagine how addicted I have been to PH since I found it. Your
						hardwork and commitment has clearly paid off because you have produced such a fascinating story
						and cultivated a welcoming community. Thank you Eph and Soph, this experience was truly
						remarkable.

					<p>Hi Eph and Soph! I first starting reading PH a few months ago and I absolutely love it! The
						series is so addicting and well-written. I adore the character designs as well, Kym is so
						lovable and the life of the party but most of the time is a facade, Will is the responsible type
						who feels like he has to shoulder everything after Rafael left but, in truth, he can't. Lauren
						is depriving herself of sleep all because of her trauma of losing her childhood best friend,
						Dylan and would sacrifice anything to stop the PS once and for all. But in acting as Lune with
						Kieran, she both saved Ardhalis from catastrophe for another day and traumatized her family and
						loved ones. We saw in recent episodes how Kym and Will felt, believing, thinking they lost their
						best friend. Will bottles it up but losing yet another best friend to a fire and/or explosion
						must have been a horrible experience. We also have yet to see Kieran's full backstory. I'd like
						to keep this short, so you two have made an amazing story and I can't wait to see more!</p>

					<p>Honestly, it seems like it was only yesterday that I was scrolling through discover looking for a
						new webtoon to read and I stumbled upon PH. When I had started reading it I was immediately
						entranced with the artwork and story line. I also loved the fact that it had a good amount of
						comedic relief . For example:(When Lauren had thrown the news paper when she was upset and the
						News Paper said and I quote ‚ÄúThrow me harderüò©!‚Äù So, whenever Eph and Soph had announced that
						they had gotten featured (and that they found out while on the toilet) I literally started
						screaming with joy but at the same time it felt bittersweet because it meant that I‚Äôd have to
						wait a while for it to be re-released and that meant Lyfe would also be put on hold. Which I
						didn‚Äôt mind at all because that meant that the author and artist along with the comic that I‚Äôd
						fallen in love with was finally getting the attention it deserved. At the time I was also
						reading Lyfe as well which I will say as a side note I‚Äôm still hoping that one day you‚Äôll be
						able to finish that one as well because I was also invested in Lyfe as well. Anyways sorry I
						digressed for a moment. I‚Äôd like to say that it‚Äôs been an honor being able to be with you both,
						along with PH from the beginning. Along the way I‚Äôve been so grateful that I‚Äôve been able to
						laugh and cry(I know that over the years I‚Äôve helped fill your cup up with tears on multiple
						occasions) and see not only the story unfold beautifully but also the art grow as well to become
						even more of a masterpiece (You were already an amazing artist to begin with). Also, the fact
						that you both are literally the same age as me helped me a lot because you made me realize that
						even though we‚Äôre young it doesn‚Äôt mean that we can‚Äôt accomplish something great. You both gave
						me a sense of comfort whenever I felt like I wouldn‚Äôt be able to accomplish anything in my life
						(granted now I‚Äôll be 22 this year and that my life is still beginning) Nevertheless, I feel like
						I‚Äôve grown alongside you both and the one thought that pushed me to keep going and become a
						better person was that, if you both can do it then I can do it too! So thank you, both of you,
						in more ways than one ( for the beautiful story and for your comforting personalitiesüíï)! P.s I

					<p>Dear Purple Hyacinth - team,
						isn't it incredible what you've achieved so far?
						Soph, Eph, thank you. Really, thank you!
						Your work is just amazing and cannot be praised enough. Just look at this community you built
						up, at this so very unique fandom you've created with your passion for something you love. Thank
						you for hearing us, for interacting so much with us and for bearing with us. Thank you for
						everything.
						Soph, thank you for being so close to us, your fandom, thank you for trying to entertain us even
						during the hiatus, thank you for your streams, your incomparable music and for your math riddle
						and thank you, Soph, for one of the most recognizable pieces of art there ever will be on earth.
						Eph, thank you for this wonderfully deep, tragic, but also poetic story. Thank you for showing
						not only the good, funny and enjoyable sides of life, but also for showing the reality with its
						downs.
						Thanks to you two, we, your fans, are allowed to dive into a new world that shows and give us so
						much. A world that lets us forget our own world for a little while and shows us that humanity
						can indeed be beautiful. You two are the prove that it doesn't take more than two talented
						humans to give us such a world. Thank you for your passion, your hard work that is evident in
						every sentence of the series and in every live of every drawing. Thank you for everything, your
						dedication is very much appreciated.
						Lastly, thank you for bringing tears to our eyes, for making us laugh and cry. These three years
						were only the beginning of something great!
						Thank you, merci beaucoup

						for me to think about; i read purple hyacinth for escapism only to encounter characters that are
						so real and made me feel so comforted, i really can't put it in any other way. at the end, i had
						to face my problems because of that and it was one of the best feelings i've had so truly, thank

						could've known how well authors were at both their stories, and their world building. You're
						both great and wonderful authors who of couse, love their reader's tears of torture, but more
						than that, you are people who genuinely enjoy the world you've created and shared. Never stop
						doing and persuing whay you love Eph and Soph. To the success of Eph's path to becoming a
						doctor, and to the success of PH completing it's phenomenonal story.
						Happy 3rd PH anniversary and happy belated bday Eph :)
